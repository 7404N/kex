Tools and extra classes needed for my other projects.
Some of the classes here will make their ways into the main Torch
branch if they turn out to be useful.

Requirements
* Torch7 (github.com/andresy/torch)

Installation
* Install Torch7 (refer to its own documentation).
* clone kex into dev directory of Torch7.
* Rebuild torch, it will include kex too.
